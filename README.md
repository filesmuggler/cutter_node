# cutter_node
ROS node for cutting out desired shapes from the Intel RealSense D435 aligned depth image 
## Requirements
The node is mainly developed and tested on [Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) with [ROS Melodic Morenia](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu), so it is a recommended setup. 

The rest of the tools used in this guide can be installed with apt:
```
sudo apt install python-rosdep python-catkin-tools python-vcstool
```
